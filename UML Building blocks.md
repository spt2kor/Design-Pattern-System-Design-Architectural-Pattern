## [UML - Building Blocks](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/uml_building_blocks.htm)
### UML building blocks.
* Things
* Relationships
* Diagrams

#### Things
	Things are the most important building blocks of UML. Things can be −
* Structural
* Behavioral
* Grouping
* Annotational

#### Structural things define the static part of the model. 
* Class − Class represents a set of objects having similar responsibilities.
* Interface − Interface defines a set of operations, which specify the responsibility of a class.
* Collaboration −Collaboration defines an interaction between elements.
* Use case −Use case represents a set of actions performed by a system for a specific goal.
* Component −Component describes the physical part of a system.
* Node − A node can be defined as a physical element that exists at run time.

#### Behavioral Things: consists of the dynamic parts of UML models.
* Interaction − a behavior that consists of a group of messages exchanged among elements to accomplish a specific task.
* State machine − state of an object in its life cycle. It defines the sequence of states an object goes through in 
				response to events. Events are external factors responsible for state change
#### Grouping Things : Grouping things can be defined as a mechanism to group elements of a UML model together.
* Package − Package is the only one grouping thing available for gathering structural and behavioral things.

#### Annotational Things:
* Annotational things can be defined as a mechanism to capture remarks, descriptions, and comments of UML model elements.


### Relationship : It shows how the elements are associated with each other and this association describes the functionality of an application. There are four kinds of relationships available.

* Dependency : Dependency is a relationship between two things in which change in one element also affects the other.
* Association: a set of links that connects the elements of a UML model. It also describes how many objects are taking part in that relationship.
* Generalization:  a relationship which connects a specialized element with a generalized element. It basically describes the inheritance relationship in the world of objects.
* Realization :  a relationship in which two elements are connected. One element describes some responsibility, which is not implemented and the other one implements them. This relationship exists in case of interfaces.

### UML Diagrams : UML diagrams are the ultimate output of the entire discussion. All the elements, relationships are used to make a complete UML diagram and the diagram represents a system. UML includes the following nine diagrams, the details of which are described in the subsequent chapters.

* Class diagram
* Object diagram
* Use case diagram
* Sequence diagram
* Collaboration diagram
* Activity diagram
* Statechart diagram
* Deployment diagram
* Component diagram

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## UML - Modeling Types :  There are three important types of UML modeling.
### Structural Modeling :Structural modeling captures the static features of a system. They consist of the following −
* Classes diagrams
* Objects diagrams
* Deployment diagrams
* Package diagrams
* Composite structure diagram
* Component diagram

### Behavioral Modeling: Behavioral model describes the interaction in the system.
* Activity diagrams
* Interaction diagrams
* Use case diagrams

### Architectural Modeling
- Architectural model represents the overall framework of the system. It contains both structural and behavioral elements of the system. Architectural model can be defined as the blueprint of the entire system. 
* Package diagram comes under architectural modeling.

## UML - Basic Notations :
* Structural Things
** Classes
** Object
** Interface
** Collaboration
** Use case
** Active classes
** Components
** Nodes

* Behavioral Things : interactions and state machines.
** Interactions can be of two types −
*** Sequential (Represented by sequence diagram)
*** Collaborative (Represented by collaboration diagram)

* Grouping Things
** Package Notation
